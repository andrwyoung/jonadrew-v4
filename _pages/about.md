Hi! I'm Andrew, a freelance illustrator located in Seattle, Washington. 

I started drawing during my freshman year of college in 2017. I didn't have any prior experience, so tried my hardest to grow and learn online, and I really loved it! After college, I moved up to Seattle to work as a Software Engineer and left that job after a year because I want to try making a living doing art. I am really just interested to try things out and see what works for me.

I'm most active on [Instagram-](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/), and you can also reach me through email me at <andrew@jonadrew.com>. I would love to get to know you!

#### Why the name Jonadrew?
In middle school, my friend Jonathan and I wanted to make video games together, and Jonadrew was the name we used. I kept using the name when I became interested in making music ([Newgrounds-](https://jonadrew.newgrounds.com)), up until now when I love drawing and painting. So although Jonathan isn't involved in this project anymore, I continue to use this name because it represents my creative journey.
