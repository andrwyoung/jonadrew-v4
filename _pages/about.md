Hi. I'm currently working full time as a software engineer in the Seattle Washington area.
 I draw paint and take photos in my free time, but hope to one day do art for a living. I'm
 mostly on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/), but I also have a gallery up on 
 [Daily Paint Works](https://www.dailypaintworks.com/Artists/-jonadrew-13091) for most of 
 my oil paintings
