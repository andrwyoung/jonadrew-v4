Hi! I'm Andrew, a freelance illustrator located in Seattle, Washington. 

I started drawing during my freshman year of college in 2017. I didn't have any prior experience, so tried my hardest to grow and learn online, and I really loved it! After college, I moved up to Seattle to work as a Software Engineer and left that job after a year because I wanted to try to make a living doing art. I don't know if it will work out, but I believe that there is no failure even if it doesn't.

I'm most active on [Instagram-](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/), and you can also reach me through email me at <andrew@jonadrew.com>, I would love to get to know you!
