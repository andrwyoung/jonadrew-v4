Hi. I'm Andrew, an artist located in Seattle, Washington. My goal is to be financially independent by selling my art, and by doing freelance illustration and concept art work. I'm most active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/). You can reach me just through Instagram or through email: jonadrew.art@gmail.com

<br />

Below you can sign up for my **Weekly Wednesday Newsletter**! The goal of this newsletter is for people to see what I've been up to. I'll be giving updates on what I've been working on and such, as well as some things I found inspiring recently.
