Hi! I'm Andrew, a self taught Freelance Illustrator located in Seattle, Washington. 

I started drawing in college and fell in love with it. I moved up to Seattle for an engineering job but left to make a living doing Illustration. Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors and playing guitar. 

Currently I'm do book cover and board game art, but I'm open to trying out different things. I would love to hear from you! You can reach out to me at <andrew@jonadrew.com>, and I am most active on [Instagram-](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/)

<!-- #### Why the name Jonadrew?
In middle school, my friend Jonathan and I wanted to make video games together, and Jonadrew was the name we used. I kept using the name when I became interested in making music , up until now when I love drawing and painting. So although Jonathan isn't involved in this project anymore, I continue to use Jonadrew because it represents my creative journey. -->
