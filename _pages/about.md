Hi! I'm Andrew, a Freelance Illustrator located in Seattle, Washington. 

I started drawing during my freshman year of college in 2017. I didn't have any prior experience, so tried my hardest to grow and learn online, and I really loved it! After college, I moved up to Seattle to work as a Software Engineer and left that job after a year because I want to make a living doing art. Currently I'm looking to do book cover and board game art, but I'm open to trying out different things. I would love to hear from you!

You can reach out to me at <andrew@jonadrew.com>, and I am most active on [Instagram-](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/)

<!-- #### Why the name Jonadrew?
In middle school, my friend Jonathan and I wanted to make video games together, and Jonadrew was the name we used. I kept using the name when I became interested in making music , up until now when I love drawing and painting. So although Jonathan isn't involved in this project anymore, I continue to use Jonadrew because it represents my creative journey. -->
