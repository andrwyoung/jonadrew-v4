<!-- #### Why the name Jonadrew?
In middle school, my friend Jonathan and I wanted to make video games together, and Jonadrew was the name we used. I kept using the name when I became interested in making music , up until now when I love drawing and painting. So although Jonathan isn't involved in this project anymore, I continue to use Jonadrew because it represents my creative journey. -->
