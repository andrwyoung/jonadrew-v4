Hi. I'm Andrew, and I currently working full time as a software engineer in the Seattle Washington area. I have a lot of stories I want to tell, and am working on becoming a comic book artist to tell them. I'm mostly on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/)





Elsewhere, I tried my hand at making games on [itch.io](https://jonadrew.itch.io/) for a little. I also used to "compose" music back in the day on [Newgrounds](https://jonadrew.newgrounds.com) lol
 
  <!-- but I also have a gallery up on 
 [Daily Paint Works](https://www.dailypaintworks.com/Artists/-jonadrew-13091) for most of 
 my oil paintings -->
