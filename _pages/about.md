Hi. I'm Andrew, an artist located in Seattle, Washington. My goal is to be financially independent by selling my art, and by doing freelance illustration and concept art work. I'm most active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/). You can reach me just through Instagram or through email: jonadrewchong(at)gmail.com

<br />

To get updates you can sign up for my **Weekly Wednesday Newsletter**! The goal of this newsletter is people to see how I am doing/growing. I'll be giving updates on what I've done the past week, what I'm currently working on, and the goals that I have.
