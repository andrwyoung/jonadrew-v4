		<h1>Digital Art</h1>
		<p>Here's a recent collection of some of my favorite digital painting pieces!</p>
		<p>Most of these are on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonadrew_/">Instagram</a>
			account if you want more context. 
			Pretty much all of these are drawn using a photo reference 
			(I think you can guess which one isn't) and using Procreate on my iPad air.</p>
