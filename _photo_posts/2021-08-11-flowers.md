My friend in which I have a platonic relationship with bought me these flowers 
because I offered to drive her to the airport and because she said it's nice for
women to buy men flowers sometimes. 

I was going to take more photos, but unfortunately they
started to wilt because we're having a sort of a heat wave this week.
